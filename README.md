# Store Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes Diwali sales data using Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries. The dataset is read from a CSV file and cleaned to remove unnecessary columns and null values. The analysis includes:

- **Gender Analysis**: A comparison of the count and total amount spent by different genders. Females have higher purchasing power.

- **Age Group Analysis**: Exploration of sales based on age groups, with the 26-35 age group being the primary buyers.

- **State-wise Analysis**: Identification of top states with the highest orders and total sales.

- **Marital Status Analysis**: Analysis of sales based on marital status, highlighting married women as prominent buyers.

- **Occupation Analysis**: Exploration of purchases based on various occupations, indicating IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors as key contributors.

- **Product Category Analysis**: Examination of popular product categories and their corresponding sales amounts.

- **Product ID Analysis**: Identification of top products based on order count.
